# WhatsApp Reader
WhatsApp Reader :speech_balloon: is a web application to easily read WhatsApp chats from **email text backups** in a easy-to-read user interface, because reading from the backup text file is too boring.

You simply need to upload the ".txt" file of your chat. You can get the ".txt" file from the **Email Conversation** button in your WhatsApp.

_It may not be 100% accurate as I built this to read a piece of chat I found in my inbox._
