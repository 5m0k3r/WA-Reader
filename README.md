# WhatsApp Reader
WhatsApp Reader is a PHP based web application for a person to easily see his chats with his friends in a familiar user interface of WhatsApp, because reading from the backup text (.txt) file is too boring.
You simply need to upload the ".txt" file of your chat. You can get the ".txt" file from the **Email Conversation** button in your WhatsApp.
_It may not be 100% correct, since I simply built this to read a piece of chat I found in my Inbox, and I hope it is useful for several others like me._

* **Is my chat getting saved?**

> No. Your chat gets deleted as soon as you upload the File. You can feel safe on that front


* **Can I preview my chat if I have uploaded it once?**

> No. Since your chat is getting deleted as soon as you upload the File, you cannot preserve your chat history for you to visit later.
